Recipe-API
This project was created using Java
This is a complete code for the backend
The frontend is still in progress and has not been updated yet
For the reference table, I was thinking of making a reference table which will have both the client ID and reference ID, allowing users to use just their client ID to pick out their all recipes and a way to link client table and recipe table together.
